        <h1><em> The Malkuth Grimoire </em></h1>
        <img class= "image" src="album1.jpg" alt="album cover">
        <p> 
            "Some of the most dynamically diverse extreme metal you will listen to, period. The album moves effortlessly between blistering technical passages and more atmospheric, progressive sections, rewarding repeated listens with new discoveries each time." &mdash; Metal Archives
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em>The Malkuth Grimoire</em> is a stunning showcase of not only the immense talents of the individual musicians, but the overall experience and band chemistry they share as a unit. Each song is densely layered yet cohesive, demonstrating technical mastery without ever feeling chaotic or overdone." &mdash; Angry Metal Guy

        <h1><em> Liquid Anatomy</em></h1>
        <img class= "image" src="album2.jpg" alt="album cover">
        <p> 
            "The best part about <em>Liquid Anatomy</em> is its tight, spare songwriting. Some supergroups get in each other's way, despite their best intentions; on this album, both the song styles and interplay between the members' instrumental offerings are smoothly balanced, with everything they've produced on display." &mdash; Metalreviews.com
        </p>
        <p>
            "It was clear from the outset that this was not going to be a boring listen. Certain expectations go with the epithet Progressive Death Metal … It's definitely an interesting start … Each track here has bucket loads of personality and identity. <em>Liquid Anatomy</em> is entertainingly abnormal, full to bursting with ideas and stellar technical darkness. Brilliant." &mdash; Ave Noctum

        <img class= "image" src="album3.jpg" alt="album cover">
        <p> 
            "Musically Alkaloid is a phenomenal force and despite losing guitarist Danny Tunker, they don't miss a beat … Christian Münzner and Morean share the load, combining tech death wizardry with chunky riffage and progressive flair, keeping the listener on their toes." &mdash; Angry Metal Guy
        </p>
        <p>
            "In an endless sea of terrifyingly creative soundscapes, tracks like <em>The Folding</em> still stand out … alternating between severely downtuned guitars … before dropping the listener into pits of silence with natural harmonics like pinpricks of light in the faraway abyss." &mdash; Metal Wani
